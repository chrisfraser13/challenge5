This App is a Work-day schedule planner



How it works:

The app displays the current date and time at the top of the page. 

It works by placing events in time slots that are divided by the hour. 

The red time block indicates the current time slot. 

The green time blocks indicate upcoming events.

The red time block will turn grey when the current time slot passes.

The grey blocks indicate that specific time slot has passed.
